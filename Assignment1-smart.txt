1. What is 7 to the power of 4?
code:
print(pow(7,4))
output:
2401

2.  Split this string into a list. 
    s = "Hi there Sam!"

code:
str="hi there Sam"
l=str.split()
print(l)

output:
['hi', 'there', 'Sam']


3.Given the variables
    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742
Use .format() to print the following string
The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.

code:

planet="Earth"
diameter=12742
str="The diameter of {} is {} kilometers"
print(str.format(planet,diameter))

output:

The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers


4.Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello
    lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]

code:

lst=[1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]
print(lst[3][1][2][0])

output:
hello

5. Given this nested dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky
    d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}


code:

d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}
print(d['k1'][3]['tricky'][3]['target'][3])

output:

hello


6.What is the main difference between a tuple and a list?
Lists are mutable

LIST

Implication of iterations is Time-consuming
The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion
Lists consume more memory
Lists have several built-in methods
The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur
    
TUPLE
    
Tuples are immutable.
The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster.
Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements.
Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list.
Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
In tuple, it is hard to take place.

7.Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form : user@domain.com
    So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com

code:
def domainGet(email):
   print("Your domain is: " + email.split('@')[-1])

email = input("Please enter your email: >")
domainGet(email)

output:

Please enter your email: >amrithraj97@gmail.com
Your domain is: gmail.com

8. Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string. 
    Don't worry about edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do account for capitalization.

code:

def findDog(st):
    if 'dog' in st.lower():
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

st = input("Please key a string: >")
findDog(st)

output

Please key a string: >dog
true

Please key a string: >cat
False

9. Use lambda expressions and the filter() function to filter out words from a list that don't start with the letter 's'.
    For example:
    seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
    should be filtered down to:    ['soup','salad']

cocde:

seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
list(filter(lambda word: word[0]=='s',seq))

ouput:
['soup', 'salad']



10. You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function
      to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". 
      If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 
      and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big    Ticket".
     Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) --
     on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases. 

code:

print("Please enter the speed(km/h)(only number please):")
speed = int(input("> "))

print("Please enter your birthday: (in DD/MM/YYYY format)")
birthday = str(input(">"))

def speeding(speed, birthday):
    if birthday == '29/08/1989':
        s = speed - 5
    else:
        s = speed

    if s <= 60:
        print("You pass.")
    elif s > 61 and s <= 80:
        print("You get a small ticket")
    else:
        print("You get a big ticket.")

speeding(speed, birthday)

output:

Please enter the speed(km/h)(only number please):
> 80
Please enter your birthday: (in DD/MM/YYYY format)
>24/03/1994
You get a small ticket


Please enter the speed(km/h)(only number please):
> 60
Please enter your birthday: (in DD/MM/YYYY format)
>12/03/1967
You pass.
